What are these tutorials?
-------------------------
Contained here are C++ tutorials I have written to provide an overview of the C++ language.  

Who are they geared towards?
----------------------------
These tutorials serve to introduce the interested reader to the object-oriented aspects/syntax of C++.  
Someone who is not familiar with object-oriented aspects will find these tutorials valuable.  Additionally, someone 
moving from C to C++ will find value here.

These tutorials assume previous experience in other programming languages, so the basics 
of functions, variables, loops, streams, i/o, etc are not covered here.  Instead, the focus is 
on syntax and concepts within C++, including classes, ojbects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

What these tutorials are NOT
----------------------------
The goal of these tutorials is to show as little code as possible to highlight the concept 
being discussed.  As such, these tutorials are by no means production-level code.  Many of the 
examples are contrived to highlight a technique or concept, and as such may omit 
unnecessary-for-the-purpose-of-illustration things, such as constructors or destructors when 
not needed in the example.  Additionally, safe and defensive coding practices such as error-handling 
and proper bounds-checking are not included for brevity.

Testing/Compile Environment
